# Arc-Unity-Game


## Design of the game
 
A ship is at the bottom of the screen, and various enemies are at the top that come down and attack the player ship.
After the player dies, a basic Game Over screen is displayed, after which the player may choose to hit the play button again and try another session. 
Difficulty increases over time.
